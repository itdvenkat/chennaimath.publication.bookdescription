Swami Prabhananda's book 'First Meetings with Sri Ramakrishna' is a study of the early contacts of the intimate disciples of the Master and the extent of influence he exercised on them from the very beginning. The common reader, not so research-minded also will get from this volume many interesting glimpses of the variety of charming ways in which Ramakrishna responded to the spiritual needs of those who approached him sincerely.
