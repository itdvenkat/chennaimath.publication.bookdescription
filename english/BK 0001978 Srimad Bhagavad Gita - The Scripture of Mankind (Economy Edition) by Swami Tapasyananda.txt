This book provides an economy edition of the Text, with all facilities for serious students to study the verses - these facilities being introductory summary of each chapter, the text in Devanagiri, its transliteration in Roman script, the prose order with word for word meaning in Roman script, running translation and annotations wherever necessary. It is hoped that this edition will meet the need of a large cross section of spiritual enquirers who want to study the Gita in the Original .
