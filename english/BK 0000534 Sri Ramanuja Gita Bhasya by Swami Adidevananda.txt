Srimad Bhagavad Gita Bhashya (Ramanuja) has been done by Swami Adidevananda, a distinguished member of the Ramakrishna Order of Sannyasins. His present translation of the Gita Bhasya is of special importance, because it is the only translation with the original Sanskrit text now available for readers interested in the philosophy of Sri Ramanuja.
