Sri Sarada Devi as a spiritual yet human consort of Bhagvan Sri Ramakrishna came with him to help in his divine play like Sita Devi with Sri Ramachandra, Bishnupriya with Sri Chaitanya and so on. But very few people recognized Sri Sarada Devi because she never gave any clue about her divinity except on a few occasions. Only people who understood her greatness in the early years were the Apostles of Sri Ramakrishna. Thus, in this book, a humble effort has been made to compile the utterances of the Apostles on Sarada Devi that will help as an easy guide for a genuine spiritual seeker trying to understand her divinity.
