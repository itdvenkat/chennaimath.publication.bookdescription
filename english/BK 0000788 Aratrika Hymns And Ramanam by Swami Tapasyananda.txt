The hymns included in this book are all the inspired compositions of the Direct disciples of Sri Ramakrishna and are sung during or immediately after the rites connected with the Aratrika in all the centers of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission. These are the fervent outpourings of the Apostles of the Great Master who in their lives had experienced " the touch of the One in the play of the many." "Ramanam" is a liturgical composition expounding the glory of Sri Rama through a series of names that suggestively highlight the main incidents in the life-story of this Divine Incarnation. This book contains a lucid and faithful English translation of the texts to enable the
reader to absorb better the spirit of these hymns. A transliteration of the texts in Roman script is also included to help those who are not very familiar with the Devanagari script.
