The Mother as I Saw Her by Swami Saradeshananda is a book of reminiscences on Sri Sarada Devi, the Holy Mother, by one who had occasion to hear and see much of what he has recorded. Thus this small bunch of reminiscence has the virtue of revealing the very core of unique personality of Mother and therefore claim to be one of the original works of first rate authority and importance on her.
