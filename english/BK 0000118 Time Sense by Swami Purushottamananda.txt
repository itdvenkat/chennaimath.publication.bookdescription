Time plays a decisive role in a student's life. Now-a-days many students waste their time in useless pursuits particularly in the beginning of an academic year. Later when exams are near they complain that they don't have sufficient time to complete their portions. This points to their lack of clear thinking about value of time. This booklet "Time Sense" deals with these problems and shows a way to solve them. Besides dealing with the subject of time management this booklet also contains a section on how a student can make use of the practice of prayer to enhance his self-confidence and concentration.
