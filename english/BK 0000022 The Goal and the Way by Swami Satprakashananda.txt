The key to the solution of life's problems is the right determination of the goal and the way of life. Vedanta ascertains the goal and the way of life in view of what man really is. Man's plan of living depends on this idea of man. The search for the meaning of life ends with the finding of man's true nature and the process of its fulfillment. Thus the theme of this book is presented with arguments from the standpoint of common understanding and valid experience. The author has also quoted the words of recognized authorities to corroborate the Vedantic view.
