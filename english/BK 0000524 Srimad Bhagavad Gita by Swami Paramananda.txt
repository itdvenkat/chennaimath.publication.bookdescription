This book is translated from the original sanskrit text by Swami Paramananda. The living voice of the Divine Teacher on the battlefield of Kurukshetra rings forth in every line, as if Sri Krishna Himself were reiterating His sacred teachings to a new age and a new people. The living force thus transmitted in such full measure by the translator cannot fail to carry a deeper understanding of the wonderful Holy Words of the Bhagavad-Gita to all who may turn to them for light on strength or peace.
