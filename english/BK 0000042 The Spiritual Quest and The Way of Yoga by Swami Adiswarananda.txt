There is a proliferation of books on Vedanta and Yoga these days but unfortunately, there is a visible lack of authentic expositions. There is hence a growing need for genuine and reliable publications. Swami Adiswarananda's book 'The Spiritual Quest and The Way of Yoga' drawing on the timeless message of the Upanishads and other scriptures juxtaposed with the wisdom of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda is indeed a timely volume. All seekers of Truth and the aspirers of higher life will find this book spiritually and intellectually rewarding.
