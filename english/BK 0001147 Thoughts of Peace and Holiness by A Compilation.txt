Sri Ramakrishna's teachings are an eternal wellspring of wisdom and solace. He spoke in a homely language from what he himself had practised and experienced, using illustrations from daily life and drove his point straight to heart. The aim of this booklet is to present a collection of his inspiring sayings which one can carry around even while traveling or read them while waiting at a queue or just to introduce one to Sri Ramakrishna's timeless wisdom.
