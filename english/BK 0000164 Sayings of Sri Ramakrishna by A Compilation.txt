Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna possessed not only a great intellect and an artistic mind, but he had seen God face to face and talked to him and shared the divine life. Hence his words on these transcendental themes come with a weight of authority derived from the Supreme Being Himself. The sayings of Sri Ramakrishna included in this volume speak for themselves as far as their spiritual value and philosophic depth are concerned.
