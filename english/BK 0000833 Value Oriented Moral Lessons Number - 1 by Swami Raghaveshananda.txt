This is the first of a series of books written to inculcate faith in God in the young minds. Once such a faith is cultivated it helps the children to develop respect for parents teachers and elders which in turn helps to bring peace and happiness to the home. Parents and teachers should help the little ones to memorise the prayers so that they will remain a source of strength throughout their lives.
