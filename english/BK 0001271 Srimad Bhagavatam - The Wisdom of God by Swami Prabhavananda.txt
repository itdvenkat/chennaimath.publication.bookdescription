The Srimad Bhagavatham is the most authorative of indian scriptures after the Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita.Its peculiar excellence is that it reconciles the heart with the head, devotion with learning. Sri Ramakrishna said, "It is fried in the butter of Knowledge and steeped in the honey of Love." This book contains the translation of the interesting portions of the Srimad Bhagavatham by Swami Prabhavananda.
