The souls of Man is a set of four lectures delivered at Chirstmas-tide of 1909 by Swami Ramakrishnananda, the Apostle of Sri Ramakrishna in the South and the founder President of Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras. The Swami was a great scholar and thinker who could explain the most abstruse philosophical ideas with remarkable clarity. His analysis is incisive, and logic, charming. In these talks, we can see how patiently he examines the foundations of science and the insights of Vedanta and firmly establishes that Self Knowledge is the infallible means for permanent happiness.
