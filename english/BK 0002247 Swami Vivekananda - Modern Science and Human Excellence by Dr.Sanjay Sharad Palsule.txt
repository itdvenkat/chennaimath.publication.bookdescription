?What we need today is western science coupled with Vedanta - the spiritual knowledge. Science and religion will meet and shake hands...This will be the religion of the future; and if we can work it out, we may be sure that it will be for all times and people?. ?Swami Vivekananda

?When relied on separately, science and religion can be counter-productive in the long run, but when combined harmoniously, can bring about an all-round expression of human genius and total fulfilment?. ?Swami Ranganathananda

In the entire religious history of the world, perhaps Swami Vivekananda was the first spiritual leader who emphasized on cultivating scientific values and approaching religion with a scientific mind. He not only proclaimed the possibility of harmonizing science and religion, but also emphasized its urgent need. He wanted everyone to strive to assimilate all positive values of all human endeavour to achieve excellence in every walk of life, an over-all excellence, the ?Human Excellence?.

The author of this book, Dr. Sanjay Sharad Palsule , by profusely quoting Swami Vivekananda has indicated the need for understanding the benefits and limitations of every culture and civilization and assimilating and integrating all values to create a new world civilization ? a civilization that would achieve and nurture not just Eastern Excellence or Western Excellence, but ?Human Excellence?.
