The present volume is an adaption from the Bengali publication with some additions and alterations that were felt necessary for the presentation of this wonderful life of Saint Durgacharan Nag, familiarly known as Nagmahasaya to a wider circle of readers outside Bengal. His life was so marvelous that even a casual reader of the book cannot but be struck with awe and wonder at the unique spiritual stature of the saint, although the present volume gives only a threadbare narrative of that unique life.
