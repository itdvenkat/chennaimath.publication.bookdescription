Translated by Swami Adidevananda

The stotra-ratna or the Jewel of Hymns of Sri Yamunacharya is a lyrical masterpiece of devotion. Melody of dictionand loftiness of devotion are hallmarks of this hymn. It seems to be written in the language of those who have travelled up the mysticalladder. Each stanza presents outpourings of the poet's heart in his attempt to obtain union with the Supreme. Unless the spirit ofdevotion and self-surrender enters the hearts of the reader it will not be possible to appreciate the esoteric content of the hymncompletely. But one thing strikes out nontheless and that is the faith conviction and freshness with which it reveals the spiritual moods ofthe poet-saint.
