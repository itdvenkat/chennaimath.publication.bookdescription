One of the best-loved deities of the Hindu pantheon, Hanuman is revered by believers as shri guru, an exalted guide in all matters of the intellect, skill and spirit. As Shri Rama's supreme devotee Hanuman guards the gates to his divine kingdom. Since Rama is an incarnation of Vishnu, access to Rama is access to the Preserver to the Godhead itself. And to reach Rama one must go through Hanuman.The Hanuman Chalisa literally 'The Hanuman Forty' is a song in praise of Hanuman composed in the sixteenth century AD in Avadhi (a language that is one of the main roots of Hindi) by the renowned saint-poet Goswami Tulasi Das. Among the most popular of Hindu prayers, the Chalisa is sung and chanted in hundreds of extant tunes across the villages and towns of India. This book provides the reader with the prayer in Devanagari, a transliteration in Roman script and a fluent and accurate English translation and notes.
