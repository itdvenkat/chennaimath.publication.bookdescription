Book Review:
Swami Ramakrishnananda or Shashi Maharaj was a direct disciple of
Sri Ramakrishna. Having spent more than a decade in the Baranagore Math, the first monastery of Ramakrishna Order, Shashi Maharaj came to Madras in 1897 at the instance of Swami Vivekananda. Enduring many hardships and overcoming numerous obstacles, he founded the Ramakrishna Math at Mylapore in Madras. His unequalled devotion to Sri Ramakrishna, pure life, saintly personality, and love and concern for others left an indelible impression on all those who came in touch with him. This book contains the available reminiscences of the monks and devotees who came in touch with him.
Besides reminiscences, the book has all the letters
Swami Vivekananda wrote to Shashi Maharaj, as also several appendices. Enriched with numerous pictures of Shashi Maharaj and the places and people associated with him
