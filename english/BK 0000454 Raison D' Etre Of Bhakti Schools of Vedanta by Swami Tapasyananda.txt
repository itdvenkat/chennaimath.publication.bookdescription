This volume is the Introductory essay of the book "Bhakti Schools of Vedanta". A clear understanding of its contents can be had only against the back ground of the whole book in which the systems of the great Acharyas of Bhakti Vedanta - Ramanuja Nimbarka Vallabha Madhava and Chaitanya - are dealt with. Why such systems are opposed to Sankaracharya's Advaita and whether they could be reconciled with Advaita are the questions discussed in this volume.
