The Dasavatara Stotra is a hymn to Lord Vishnu. It is the first section in the Gita-Govindam of Sri Jayadeva. It is a great poetical masterpiece in twelve cantos of mellifluous verses and songs in Sanskrit set to music and adapted to representation through dance. The theme of it is the love of Radha and Krishna symbolizing the longing and striving of the individual for communion with God culminating in their blissful union. The language and the imagery express the most intense form of love in all its moods and phases. The first section sings of ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu.
