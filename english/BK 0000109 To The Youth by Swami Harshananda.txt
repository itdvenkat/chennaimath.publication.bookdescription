Youth epitomizes the best in human life. Despite its inberent handicaps like inexperience immaturity and guillibility youth is the best time to mould oneself. The raw youth energy needs to be refined and channeled into higher endeavours for the good of the youth themselves and the society at large. The present book contains the questions asked by the students to the author of this book Swami Harshananda (a renowed and scholar monk of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission) and his answers to solve quieries of their mind during one of the youth conventions held at Bangalore. Hence it is hoped that this book will help the readers especially the youth to know their power and capabilities.
