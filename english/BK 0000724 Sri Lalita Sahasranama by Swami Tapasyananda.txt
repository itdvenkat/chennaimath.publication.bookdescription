Sri Lalita Sahasranama is an excellent appreciative but also critical study of the Sahasranama as a piece of Stotra literature and as an exposition of the philosophy of the Mother cult. It is both a historical and a doctrinal study of this worship of the Supreme Being as the Mother which is current all over India in different forms. The Introduction to this edition of Lalitasahasranama is taken from the now out-of-print translation of it by Prof. D. S. Sarma. Swami Tapasyananda the translator of this book has transliterated the original text in English accompanied by a lucid English translation which will make the chanting possible for those who have no access to Sanskrit.
