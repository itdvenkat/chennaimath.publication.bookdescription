This book is a collection of articles on the theme of health and medical science in the light of ethics religion and spirituality by Swami Brahmeshananda. The author has personally faced the problem of declining ethical codes in the practice of medicine during his more than three decades of practice as a medical consultant. Though the compiled articles are independent in themselves and were written during a span of more than fifteen years they have a common theme: search for values in the field of health and medicine. The book is primarily addressed to the medical professionals but we are sure it will prove enlightening for lay readers too.
