The present humble work is the English translation by Sri Devavrata Basu Ray which was originally written by Swami Vishwasrayananda in Bengali. This book contains the life and teaching of Swami Vijnananandaji Maharaj, a direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna and the 4th President of Sri Ramakrishna Math and Mission. He was a shining example of how Jnana, Dhyana, Karma and Bhakti can be harmoniously blended in the lover of God.
