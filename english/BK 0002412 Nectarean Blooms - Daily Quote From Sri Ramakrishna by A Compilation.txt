This book is a compilation of inspiring nectarine-like sayings of Sri Ramakrishna in the form of a daily quote, and when read, contemplated and practised every day, will improve the spiritual quality of the lives of the readers and remove the obstacles to God-realization in this modern and materialistic world. Swami Vivekananda regarded Sri Ramakrishna as the consummation of millennia of Indian spiritual tradition.
