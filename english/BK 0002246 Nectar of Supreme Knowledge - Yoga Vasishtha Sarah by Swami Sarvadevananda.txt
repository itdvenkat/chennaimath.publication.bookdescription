Original Bengali Translation and Explanation by Swami Dhireshananda
English Translation by Swami Sarvadevananda
The Yoga Vasistha is a popular Advaitic text, which explains the precepts of Advaita philosophy in form of a dialogue between Sri Rama and his preceptor Sage Vasistha. Years later, an anonymous learned scholar wrote Yoga Vasishtha Sara with 223 verses, a smaller treatise that contains only the essential philosophical conclusions of the original text.

Swami Dhireshananda, a monk of the Ramakrishna Order, had translated the Yoga Vasishtha Sara into Bengali and published it in 1968. The translations and the explanations are superb and unique, with anvaya of the Sanskrit verses and the commentary of Mahidhara, which present difficult-to-understand Ved?nta doctrines and philosophies in a language both scholarly and understandable to common readers. Swami Dhireshananda?s explanations, based on his own deep understanding and on what he heard from various highly illumined souls of the Himalayas, carry a charm which not only satisfies the intellect, but also touches the heart.

Sw?m? Sarvadev?nanda, a senior monk of Ramakrishna Order, has faithfully translated Sw?m? Dh?re??nanda?s book into English and has titled it as Nectar of Supreme Knowledge.
