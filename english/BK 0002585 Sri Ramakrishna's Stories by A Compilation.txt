Any concept can be easily explained through stories. That is why story-telling has been in vogue right from the Vedic times to our present age.

Sri Ramakrishna was an unparalleled saint in the modern age who effectively used the art of story-telling to illustrate an idea or a value. In the book <em>Sri Ramakrishnar Aruliya Kadhaigal</em> published by our Math, some of his wonderful stories were selected and re-rendered in Tamil by Swami Vimurtananda for children with explanations of the message these stories convey. Sri S. Nageshwara Rao had illustrated the book with beautiful paintings.

We are now happy to present the English version of many of the stories narrated in the Tamil book. These English stories are taken from <em>The Great Master</em>,  <em>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</em> and <em>Tales and Parables of Sri Ramakrishna</em> and have been presented here with minor modifications. We have added a ‘Message of the story’ at the end of every story to highlight the value(s) that the children can learn therefrom.

We invoke the blessing of Sri Ramakrishna on all those who were involved in the preparation of this book.
