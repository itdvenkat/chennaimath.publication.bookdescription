Invitation to Holy Company is the work of a life long Sannyasin, recording his intimate experiences with ten of the direct monastic disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, who may be designated as the Great Master's Apostles. It is hoped that the study of these accounts will induce readers to learn more of these great direct disciples, about whom there is an abundance of good literature in English at present.
