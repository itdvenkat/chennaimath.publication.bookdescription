Everyone is a natural Bhakta—devotee. The difference only lies in the fact as to what we are devoted to. Most people are devoted to earning and accumulating money, in becoming famous and powerful, in pursuits that satisfy their ego and senses and so on. While they are ‘devotees’ of the ‘world’, the genuine, real Bhakta is a devotee of the Unchanging Reality, Eternal Beloved called God and wants to pour all his love towards Him and Him alone. Such is the ideal of Bhakti. 
This book explores the rich Bhakti-traditions and describes various aspects of it.
