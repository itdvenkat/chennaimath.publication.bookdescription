The present edition of the Narayaneeyam aims at giving a lucid and readable translation of this great Sanskrit Text by Swami Tapasyananda to the English reading people interested in Indian devotional literature. As the Narayaneeyam is a condensation of the Bhagavata Purana a grasp of the specific Bhakti doctrine of the Bhagavata is very essential for the proper understanding of the Narayaneeyam especially of the Krishna episode forming its core. It is hoped that this translation of the Narayaneeyam into English will attract the attention of a wide public to this great Text and through it to the great Bhakti tradition of India.
