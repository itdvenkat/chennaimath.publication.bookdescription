The Universe God and God Realization' begins with an excellent exposition of the religion and philosophy of Vedanta and its age-old appeal to the human mind. The Vedantic view of the cosmos and the process of its creation are carefully explained including a lucid treatment of the difficult doctrine of maya (apparance) and moreover a comparison of the Vedic and the Christian conception of creation from the word.
