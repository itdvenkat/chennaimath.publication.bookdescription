What is spirituality? As in case of other fields of life, there are authentic and not-so-authentic examples and thoughts about spirituality too. Much needs to be clarified and understood about the true nature of spiritual life, its practices and obstacles. Swami Vivekananda called spirituality as the ‘science of spirit’. 
This book discusses and illustrates the truth about spiritual living through writings by eminent monks and others.
