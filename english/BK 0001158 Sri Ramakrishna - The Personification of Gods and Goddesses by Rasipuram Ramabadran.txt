According to Sri Ramakrishna ?There is only one Rama and He has a thousand names.? To restate Sri Ramakrishna?s words, ?There is only one Ramakrishna and He has a thousand names.? In other words, Sri Ramakrishna is ?Sarva Deva Devi Swarupa,? the personification of all gods and goddesses. Swami Vivekananda has said: ?Sri Ramakrishna was the embodiment of infinite ideas? He is the embodiment of infinite spiritual ideas capable of development in infinite ways. Even if one can find a limit to the knowledge of Brahman, one cannot measure the unfathomable depths of the Master?s mind.?
This book is based on all these ideas. It is a detailed study and exposition of the fundamental truth that Sri Ramakrishna is ?Sarva Deva Devi Swarupa?, the personification of all gods and goddesses...
What is true of Sri Ramakrishna is also true of Sri Sarada Devi. The Holy Mother has said of all goddesses: ?They are my own parts.? Therefore the author has identified Sri Sarada Devi with 25 different goddesses.
