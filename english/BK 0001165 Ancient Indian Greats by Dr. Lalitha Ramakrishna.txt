Swami Vivekananda's 150th Birth Anniversary Publication.

"The More, therefore, the Hindus study the past, the more glorious will be their future, and whosoever tries to bring the past to the door of everyone, is a great benefactor of his nation.? ? Swami Vivekananda

We are inheritors of a rich treasure of ideas and inventions bequeathed by our rishis. In ancient India, people past middle age withdrew from active social and familial commitments and retired to forest universities. In the serene ambience of a hermitage in the midst of Nature, sages and their disciples delved deep into the mysteries of body and mind.

Their tool was acute observation with an objective mind. Through this prism they perceived stars, animals, birds and plants. Their sensitivity enabled sages to gauge the human need for artistic expression. Some of them were ministers who advised kings on calamities and enemies.

The articles in this book were written by Dr. Lalita Ramakrishna for Tattvaloka, a spiritual journal of Sringeri Sharada Peetham published once a month from Chennai (www.tattvaloka.com).
