“The secret of right action in reality is not a secret. It does not lie in any formula that we repeat. There is no magic by means of which we can follow the path of idleness and yet make our life productive. No! The secret lies in our own motives, in our power of application. It is not the strong physical vehicle which makes the productive human being; it is skilfulness in action, knowing how to adjust ourselves quickly, how to perform a task with the least expenditure of energy. This is what gives immediate success.” Thus says Swami Paramananda, the author of this book, who was the youngest disciple of Swami Vivekananda.  This book contains illuminating insights and techniques revealing the secret of right activity.
