Mukundamala or a Garland of Hymns to Mukunda is a Sanskrit poem composed in praise of Sri Maha Vishnu by the saintly King Kulasekhara. The devotional depth and appeal of its stanzas have raised the poem to the crest of the Bhakti movement in India. The divine experience which the God-inebriate author had still rings in the ears of those who chant the poem with devotion.
