Peace is an inner urge of the human psyche. Every storm seeks subsidence in calm. This volume originally published as a series of articles in the 1986 Annual of the Vedanta Kesari represents an in-depth study of peace by a number of savants who have had practical experience in handling problems created by lack of peace.
