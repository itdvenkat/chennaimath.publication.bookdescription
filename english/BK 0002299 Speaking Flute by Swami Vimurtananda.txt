Deriving inspiration from Swamiji?s exhortation that the highest philosophy must be put in concrete moral forms so that anyone can grasp, Swami Vimurtananda, under the pseudonym of Bamatimaithan, had written several stories that were published in Sri Ramakrishna Vijayam, the Tamil monthly of the Math.

This book is a compilation and English translation of 25 such stories. The valuable teachings of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Sarada Devi, and Swami Vivekananda which are most relevant to the modern age are rendered in form of these stories so that anyone would be able to imbibe them and enrich their personal and social lives.
