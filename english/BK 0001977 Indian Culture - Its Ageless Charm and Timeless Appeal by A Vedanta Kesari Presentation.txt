Indian culture is one of the most ancient and diverse cultures in the world. What is more, it is a living culture, not tucked away in museums and dusty volumes but a living force in the daily and social lives of millions of Indians, in India and abroad.

India is one of the most religiously diverse nations in the world. Continuity, diversity and vitality of Indian culture have astonished the scholars and commoners alike. Despite these ennobling truths, it is also a fact that much needs to be done to preserve and cultivate Indian culture especially amongst youth. Dwelling on various aspects of our cultural heritage and the grand philosophy, this volume tries to bring together the scholarly and everyday approach to Indian culture. This aims at promoting understanding of Indian culture in a simple and easy-to-read style, yet retaining the seriousness and profundity of the subject.
