This book is a compilation of material culled from the three articles written by Revered Swami Bhuteshananda Maharaj, former president of the Ramakrishna Order, and lucidly explains the need of guru in leading the spiritual aspirants along the spiritual path by giving a formula called mantra repeating which they can reach the Supreme Goal. It is a very handy material for those thinking of taking spiritual initiation.
