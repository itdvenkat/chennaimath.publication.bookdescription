Almost every aspect of life revolves around inter- personal relationships. Since human beings have differences in temperaments, interests, and capacities, there are also differences in the relationships one develops with them. Difference apart, one also needs a deeper understanding of the causes that bring people together or make them sow seeds of discord. One cannot have peace of mind if one's interpersonal relationships are passing through a rough patch. Everyone faces times when he has to respond meaningfully to such a rough patch. In the ultimate analysis, what is required in handling interpersonal relationships is the inculcation of a spiritual outlook towards life. This asks for nothing less than a matured approach to life's problems. One has to understand oneself and others in the light of spiritual oneness of all human beings. When one understands it, honesty and uprightness in one's dealings--the most vital values that guide a healthy human dealing-become a natural trait of one's personality.
