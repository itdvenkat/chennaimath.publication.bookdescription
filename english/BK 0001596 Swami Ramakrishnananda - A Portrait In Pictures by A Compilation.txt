Like all the other disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, he combined Jnana, Bhakti, Yoga and Karma in his life. His utter purity, guilelessness and his overflowing love for others drew many close friends, admirers, and followers to him. Indeed, his saintly life represents an ideal which should be more widely known and followed.

This book is a narrative of the life of Swami Ramakrishnananda, through all the available photos of him and places connected with his life and presents the early days of the Ramakrishna Movement in South India, and how it set in motion a spiritual renaissance.
