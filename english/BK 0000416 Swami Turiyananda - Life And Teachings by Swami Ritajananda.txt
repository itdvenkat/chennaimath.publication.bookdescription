As a direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, he was a rare combination of extreme asceticism, sympathy, devotional fervour, Sanskrit scholarship and modern outlook. The greatest contribution of Swami Turiyananda to the spiritual heritage of India is his immaculate life. In the present book by Swami Ritajananda are included incidents, conversations, and extracts from diaries of disciples, gathered through very laborious research on the life and teachings of the great Swami Turiyananda.
