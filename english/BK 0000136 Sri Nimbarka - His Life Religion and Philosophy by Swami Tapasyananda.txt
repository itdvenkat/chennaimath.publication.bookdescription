?r? Nimb?rka presents the Ultimate Reality as Radha-Krishna. Krishna being the Lord of Love and Radha the Power of Love. The personage treated in this book is ?r? Nimb?rka. Besides his philosophy, a detailed account of his life is given. For it is the support of the life that gives more authority to their teachings than the philosophical writings of mere armchair philosophers. This book is intended to bring to the notice of the general reader that it is not correct to equate Ved?nta exclusively with Advaita Ved?nta, associated with ?r? ?a?kar?c?rya. There are several other ?c?ryas who have expounded the Ved?nta in quite a different way and whose status as teachers of Ved?nta requires recognition.
