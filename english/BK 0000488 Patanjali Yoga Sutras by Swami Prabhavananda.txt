This English translation of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras was originally published by the Vedanta Society Southern California for the benefit of readers who do not know Sanskrit and yet are interested in Indian psychology which plumbs the depths of the human mind. Swami Prabhavananda has taken special pains in this book to present the philosophy and practice of Yoga in a non-technical up to date phraseology that can be understood and enjoyed by all enquiring minds.
