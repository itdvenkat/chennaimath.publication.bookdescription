Sri Ramakrishna was a living embodiment of Godliness. His sayings are not those of a merey learned man, but are pages from the book of life. Mahendranath Gupta has recorded his sublime utterances with stenographic precision. Therefore they are a beacon light to all who tread the spiritual path, to whichever race or religion they may belong.
