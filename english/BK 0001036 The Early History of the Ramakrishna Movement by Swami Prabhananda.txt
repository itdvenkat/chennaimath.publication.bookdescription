The present humble work is an honest attempt to briefly study how Sri Ramakrishna's mission proceeded particularly during its early years towards fulfillment and in the process how The Ramakrishna Movement grew and developed in the early days. One charming feature of the book is the number of photos, illustrations and maps which explain the texts. This book will surely become the authoriatative source book for anyone doing research on the Ramakrishna Movement.
