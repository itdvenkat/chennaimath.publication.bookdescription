They bear witness to the Master?s consummate wit and keenness of observation. Many of his parables are drawn from ordinary domestic and social life, customary with the people who lived arround him. Thus, this collection of the parables published for the first time in separate book form will be of service to all who wish to get some acquaintance with the fundamentals of spiritual life through the interesting medium of parables and stories.
