Book Review:
Based on the short monographs Sri Ramakrishna, Holy Mother and Swami Vivekananda and direct disciples of Sri Ramakrishna by Swami Bhajanananda, one of the Assistant Secretaries of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. Originally meant for Belur Math website (www.belurmath.org), these essays place the subject quite contextually. Narrated in a lucid style, the book also has additional matter from other writings of the author.
