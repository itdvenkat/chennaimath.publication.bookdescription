A thoroughgoing study of Advaita Vedanta in the light of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda's teaching has been a long-felt need. Swami Sunirmalananda the translator of this book has made a humble attempt towards this end. Here in this book on each verse, the translator gives a running commentary wherein he explains the thrust of the verse as illustrated by the observation of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda in relevant contexts. Several drawings and charts have been included to aid comprehension. It is hoped that the reader will be acquainted with the numerous aspects of Advaita through this book.
