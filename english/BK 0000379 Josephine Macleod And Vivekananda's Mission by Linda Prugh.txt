This book is a biography of Josephine Macleod, but interwoven with it is Vivekananda's Vedantic mission. One will find in this book religion, philosophy, and mysticism; manners, customs, and cultures of the East and West. Linda Prugh, the author of this book, worked extremely hard to research and document in detail the early history of the Ramakrishna Movement in West as well as in the East.
