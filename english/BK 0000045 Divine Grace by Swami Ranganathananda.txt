This book is a discussion of the idea of Grace and Love as the ultimate of spiritual development and fulfillment. It is an elegant response to the age-old question of the relationship between self-effort and divine grace. 

The concept of Divine Grace is found in Hinduism, Christianity, Islam and even one school of Mahayana Buddhism. Using the writings of Swami Vivekananda and other Indian sages, and especially the Bhagavad Gita as sources, including references to the Bible,  Swami Ranganathananda discusses the need all people have for grace and love in their lives. 

Swami Ranganathananda was the 13th President of The Ramakrishna Math and Mission. He is the author of Message of the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad and The Message of Vivekachudamani among many other books. He is also the subject of the books: The Monk Without Frontiers: Reminiscences of Swami Ranganathananda and My Life Is My Work.
