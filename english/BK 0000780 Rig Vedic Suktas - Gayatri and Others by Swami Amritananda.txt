Suktas are prayers addressed to different Gods and Goddesses for diverse benefits. Swami Amritanandaji the translator of this Sukta has to his credit two publications in this line already-one on the very popular Purushasukta and the other on Asya Vamiya Suktam. He has relied mainly on Sayana's commentary in interpreting the nuances of challenging passages. And he has been able to present a lucid account of both the Suktas. His facile pen has therefore accomplished a notable task in interpreting the Gayatri and two other Suktas that ride in tandem with Gayatri.
