The contents of this book are the translation of the Bengali original named Smriti Katha (memoirs) of Swami Akhandananda, a direct Sannyasin disciple of Sri Ramakrishna. Swami Akhandananda took to heart the message of Swami Vivekananda that all souls are potentially divine and we must worship God by serving the needy. The book contains an absorbing account of the Swami's adventurous wanderings in the holy Himalayas and pioneering relief work in famine gripped villages. He set the pattern for all the relief and rehabilitation services rendered by the Ramakrishna Mission in later years.
