This book contains seven stories. Moral qualities such as truthfulness sacrifice and forgiveness form the basis of the stories. Young impressionable and tender minds can readily grasp the values of these simple great stories and broaden their outlook on life. Short prayers have been added at the end of each chapter to instil devotion in the young minds.

At the end of each story some questions are set to test how far the student has understood the story. So this volume can be used as a textbook in the classes. The teacher should supplement the stories with incidents from the lives of our great saints to inculcate the spirit of service and devotion to God in the young minds.
