The two words Concentration and Meditation form the innermost core of the practice of Yoga. Concentration and Meditation practised together are the doorway to the Inner Illumination and constitutes the central pivot round which all Sadhana in the spiritual field revolves. Swami Paramananda introduces the reader to a thorough exposition of the intricacies of Concentration and Meditation. The book is not a manual on the practice of meditation and concentration but leads the uninitiated towards an understanding of these two vital concepts on the path of rising to higher levels of consciousness and enlightenment. Literature on this subject being very rare this is an ideal book to every student
