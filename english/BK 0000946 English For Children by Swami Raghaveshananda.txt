The study of a long which starts with the alphabets stop since children are attracted by pictures illustration of the letters with pictures is a great help.

In this volume we have made any new innovation. The line-drawings are not of the type:A for 'Apple ' but expose the children to the great personalities who have enriched our cultural heritage. For instance 'A' is illustrated by Agastya and others; 'B' by Buddha and others. Therefore while getting familiar with the letters the children will also be introduced to those men and women who have made India great.

We hope that this introduction of alphabets will also stimulate the children to us by for a higher life.
