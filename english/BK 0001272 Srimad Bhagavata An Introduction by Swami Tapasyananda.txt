Srimad Bhagavata occupies a central place for all followers of bhakti (devotion). It deals with the various aspects of bhakti in detail and illustrates the ideal and the way to supreme bhakti through the life and teachings of Sri Krishna, the Godhead personified. Its sublime spiritual beauty, graceful literary style and poetic appeal have no parallels in the Puranic literature. No wonder, it is highly revered and widely read by all those who seek God through the path of love and devotion. Besides giving all relevant details about the historicity and origin of Srimad Bhagavata and its philosophy, it serves as a good appetizer for undertaking a complete study of this scripture.
