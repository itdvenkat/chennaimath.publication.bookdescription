Dharma is that which holds things together and it is a concept that applies to all the multifarious fields of human thought and activity. This book presents a symposium by eminent scholars and savants to the reader explaining about dharma which is a seminal concept not only in Hinduism but in all religions. It is hoped that this small anthology will illumine the path of righteousness trodden by the readers and inspires them to proceed faster without doubts and hesitation to the Supreme Goal.
