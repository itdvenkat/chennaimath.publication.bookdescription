Swami Vivekananda was a powerful orator, a clear writer, a nice poet, a fine humorist, a master of Indian and Western philosophy, a deep thinker, a dreamer of an ideal human society and a great social worker. From out of the waves of his vibrant voice, a sacred 108 have been inscribed in the pages of this live booklet to serve as awakening assertions and galvanizing calls to our growing youth so that they may grow into manliness and true understanding. The selection has been made from several places in the published volumes of the Swami's speeches and writings.
