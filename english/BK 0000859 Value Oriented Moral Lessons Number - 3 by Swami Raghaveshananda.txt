Moral and cultural values take deep roots in young minds. If children are exposed to noble ideas and ideals in the very early days they take to these influences readily and joyously and grow into modern citizens who can be a pride both to the nation and themselves. India's cultural and spiritual values stem from time immemorial and have survived all the ups and downs of history through the millennia. The weaknesses that stain our national character are only skin deep and can be easily removed if the growing generation is endowed with the correct values and Outlook. This series of booklets is specifically aimed at moulding the personality of the young ones. We see the hearty cooperation of both the teachers and parents to help rebuild a glorious India.
