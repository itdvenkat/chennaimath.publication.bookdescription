This book is based on the Sri Ramakrishna's statement to Narendra, "He who was Rama and Krishna is now, in this body, Ramakrishna - but not in your Vedantic sense" and the uniformity of divine qualities exhibited by the incarnations. It throws light on how Sri Ramakrishna exhibited the divine qualities that are similar to His earlier avatar of Rama and Krishna.
