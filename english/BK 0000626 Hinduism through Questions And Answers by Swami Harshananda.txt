All religions find themselves at the crossroads of history in this age of science and democracy. Traditional values of Hinduism have also been subjected to this scrutiny and these enquirers demand an explanation - philosophical, scientific and historical - for the ideas and institutions which give Hindus their identity.

This book by Swami Harshananda, a senior monk of the Ramakrishna Order, answers these questions by enquirers and critics about Hindu religion. It helps clear misconceptions about Hinduism and offers explanations about its ideas and institutions.
