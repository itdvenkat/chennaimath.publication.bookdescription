Youth is generally identified with energy, enterprise, optimism and strength. It is a time for experimentation as well as forging ahead in ones chosen path. But the period of youth is more than this. It is also the time for laying foundation for ones character, a time to respond to ones higher calling.Youth is a time for idealism but even more it is time to see ones ideal becoming true. One needs be carefuland cautious so as not to lose ones way in the conflicting world of ideals and ideas in which a youth lives. (The write-up bySwami Atmashraddhananda deals with all these issues and points out what a youth should do.)
