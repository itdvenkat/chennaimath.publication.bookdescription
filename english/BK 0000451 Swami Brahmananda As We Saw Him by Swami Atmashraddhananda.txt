Swami Brahmananda as we saw Him - Reminiscences of Monastic and Lay Devotees.
Book Review:

Swami Brahmananda (1863 - 1922) was a direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna who regarded him as his spiritual son. Also known as Raja Maharaj or simply 'Maharaj', Swami Brahmananda was the first president of the Ramakrishna Order. A man of deep meditative temperament and down-to-earth wisdom and humour, Maharaj quietly carried the mantle of guiding the fledging Ramakrishna Order in its first 21 years as also provided spiritual guidance to numerous spiritual aspirants, monastic and lay, who came in touch with him. This book is a compilation of their reminiscences and personal accounts culled from various sources.
