The Upanayana sacrament has somehow survived among the dvijas (the "twice born" class) and that too among the brahmanas even now. However unfortunately neither an awarness of its significance nor a reverent faith in its performance is seen among the votaries. Thus the aim of this small booklet is to mitigate this deficiencies and to provide a basic knowledge to keep alive these types of sacred religious traditions.
