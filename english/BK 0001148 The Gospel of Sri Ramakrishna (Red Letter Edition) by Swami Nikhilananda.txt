Sri Ramakrishna was a living embodiment of Godliness. His sayings are not those of a mere learned man, but are pages from the book of life. Mahendranath Gupta has recorded his sublime utterances with stenographic precision. Therefore they are a beacon light to all who tread the spiritual path, to whichever race or religion they may belong.The present edition has Sri Ramakrishna's words in red-letter type, thus providing the reader and immediate view of the Master's own words.
