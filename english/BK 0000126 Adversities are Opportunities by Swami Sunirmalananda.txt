The whole of Sanatana Dharma or Vedanta is a long lesson in positive thinking and positive living. Through stories and anecdotes, Vedanta endorses positive thinking at all stages of life. This book is a collection of a few inspiring stories from epics and Puranas that teach us that we should never be depressed under whatever circumstance life may land us in, for the simple reason that things are bound to change for the better.

Swami Sunirmalananda who retells these stories is a monk of the Ramakrishna Order. He was the editor of "Prabuddha Bharata" an English Monthly of the Ramakrishna Order.
