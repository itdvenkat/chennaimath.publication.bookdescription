Miss Margaret Noble became Sister Nivedita under the personal and rigorous training of Swami Vivekananda. True to her Master’s wish, amidst various difficulties and privation, she not only did phenomenal service in the field of girl education, she also aroused the dampening Indian consciousness and awakened it to its own glory. 
This booklet, authored by Swami Lokeswarananda, sketches her life and depicts her contribution to Indian renaissance in a lucid and inspiring way. The booklet can be a source of inspiration for both the young and the old.
