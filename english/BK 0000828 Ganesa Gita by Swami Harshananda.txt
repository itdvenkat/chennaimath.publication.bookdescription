Though considered as a part and parcel of the Ganesapurana this book looks more like an independent work attached to the Ganesapurana to give it acceptability since the latter is a major scripture of the Ganapatya cult. In this brochure, a brief summary of the work has been attempted. It is hoped that it will prove to be useful to the spiritual aspirants especially those devoted to Lord Ganesha.
